### Hello!  

I am Bernat Font (he/his), Assistant Professor in Data-Informed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) at TU Delft 🌀 

My research is focused in enhancing CFD solvers through data-informed models. Briefly:
- Acceleration of scale-resolving simulations using generative methods
- Data-driven wall models for turbulent non-equilibrium boundary layers
- Active flow control using reinforcement learning
  
Find more details on my personal [webpage](https://b-fg.github.io/publications/). Some addition info about me:
- 🎓 My PhD involved the development of a machine-learning turbulence model to reproduce 3D turbulence in 2D simulations
- 🌱 Mainly developing in Julia, Python, and Fortran!
- 💬 Contact me for collaborations, help, suggestions
