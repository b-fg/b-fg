### Hello!  

I am Bernat Font (he/his), Assistant Professor in Data-Informed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) at TU Delft ðŸŒ€ 

My research is focused in the exploitation of data to improve current CFD methodologies. Briefly:
- Acceleration of scale-resolving simulations using generative methods
- Data-driven wall models for equilibrium and non-equilibrium boundary layers
- Active flow control using reinforcement learning

Some addition info about me:
- ðŸŽ“ My PhD involved the development of a dimensionality-reduction method aided by machine learning which allows to obtain 3-D spatially-averaged flow in a 2-D simulation
- ðŸŒ± Mainly developing in Julia, Python, and Fortran!
- ðŸ’¬ Contact me for collaborations, help, suggestions
