### Hello!  

I am Bernat Font (he/his), Assistant Professor in Data-Informed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) at TU Delft ðŸŒ€ 

My research is focused in enhancing CFD solvers through data-informed models such as:
- Data-driven wall models for turbulent non-equilibrium boundary layers
- Active flow control using reinforcement learning
- 
I am also a co-developer of [WaterLily.jl]([url](https://github.com/WaterLily-jl/WaterLily.jl)), a popular CFD solver written in Julia.
  
Find more details on my personal [webpage](https://b-fg.github.io/). Some addition info about me:
- ðŸŽ“ My PhD involved the development of a machine-learning turbulence model to reproduce 3D turbulence in 2D simulations
- ðŸŒ± Mainly developing in Julia, Python, and Fortran!
- ðŸ’¬ Contact me for collaborations, help, suggestions: b.font at tudelft dot nl
